        2. if successful login, then simply hide this popup and show get started page. 


All other database:
1. you need to install database ( for example, download mysql  and install in your laptop )
2. you need to configure the database to the right credentials and port number
3. you need to import the data into this database by creating the right db name and table names. 
4. launch the database. 

Sqlite
1. installation ( taken care by backend api aplication )
2. configuration ( taken care by backend api )
3. import data ( shipped along with backend api source code, no need to manual import, taken care  )
4. launch ( taken care )

Futher Discussion:
1. discuss the database table structure (how many table, what columns its)
2. for google and facebook, we need either backend api developed or firebase account to achieve this.
